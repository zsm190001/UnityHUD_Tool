Additional Issues:
- I attempted to change a push/version history name on GitKraken, tried to fix my mistake with merging, and got errors regarding the merge. 
- I ended up deleting my original scene that had issues showing properly after the merge and added the tester cube & plane; this supposedly fixed the issue and fixed the merge errors. I pushed the recent changes to the repository.
